The EMT Dispatch System is a complete full-stack application that integrates a React.js frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a SQLite database to streamline emergency response operations. The backend provides REST APIs that connect to the database to store and manage information about ambulances, hospitals, emergency requests, reservations, and users, while the frontend offers a dispatcher dashboard with maps, status indicators, and interactive controls for managing operations. Through this interface, dispatchers can log in, create or update emergency requests, view ambulance and hospital availability, and assign units in real time. The backend then updates the database, processes routing logic, and determines the most efficient ambulance and hospital combination for each emergency call. By analyzing requests, checking resource availability, and calculating optimal routes, the system functions as a digital dispatcher that reduces response times, balances workloads, and ultimately ensures faster and more reliable emergency medical services.
