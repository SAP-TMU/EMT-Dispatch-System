🚑 EMS Dispatcher System – Implementation Checklist:

📌 Ambulance Dispatching (Smart Ambulance Selection)
✅ Finds the 3 closest ambulances by straight-line distance.
✅ Queries Google Maps Distance Matrix API to calculate accurate ETA considering live traffic.
✅ Selects ambulance with the lowest ETA for the patient.

📌 Hospital Bed Reservation (Smart Hospital Selection)
✅ Finds the 3 closest hospitals by straight-line distance.
✅ Queries Google Maps Distance Matrix API for hospital ETA.
✅ Reserves bed at hospital with lowest ETA and available bed.
✅ Implements reservation override logic based on priority.

📌 Ambulance Status Management
✅ Ambulances have clear statuses:
✅ available
✅ en route to patient
✅ en route to hospital
✅ idle
✅ Ambulance status updated to available only after ambulance reaches hospital (checked via 5-meter radius).
✅ Ambulance location updated and validated when marked available.

📌 Hospital Bed Management
✅ Hospital bed count explicitly managed by hospital logic.
✅ Simulated automatic clearing of expired reservations after 30 minutes.

📌 ETA Reassessment & Priority-Based Rerouting
✅ Rechecks ambulance ETA every 5 seconds to closest 3 hospitals after patient pickup.
✅ If patient priority is high and better ETA to another hospital by 5+ minutes, reroute ambulance.
✅ Properly unreserves previous hospital bed and reserves new hospital bed.

📌 Simulated Real-Time Ambulance Movement
✅ Test scripts simulate ambulance moving and updating location in real-time (for testing purposes).
✅ Simulated scenario of ambulance reaching hospital and updating status.

📌 Request Management
✅ Request clearly linked to ambulance and hospital reservations.
✅ Properly managed lifecycle from initial dispatch to hospital arrival.

📌 Testing and Simulation
✅ Automated tests (pytest) verifying:
✅ Request dispatching & ambulance/hospital selection logic
✅ Reservation & override logic
✅ ETA endpoint correctness
✅ Custom test scripts (full_system_flow_test.py, simulate_ambulance_movement.py) provided for full system tests.

📋 Items not yet implemented (based on your report):

❌ Real-Time Communication
❌ Real-time updates/communication between dispatcher, EMT units, and hospitals (e.g., WebSocket, push notifications).

❌ Logging & Monitoring
❌ Comprehensive logging of all actions, ambulance locations, reservations, and statuses.

❌ Monitoring endpoints/dashboard for administration.

❌ Frontend (Live Map Integration)
❌ Interactive live map interface showing ambulances, hospitals, requests, and live updates (previously attempted but paused).
